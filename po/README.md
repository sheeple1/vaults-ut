# Translations
Because of the language barriers, UI translation is an essential part of the development.

We really appreciate all the work you put into it! :)

## Instructions

### How does it works?
An app's UI is full of translatable strings of text. Each translatable button label, description, or title ends up here.

### How do I start?
Unless you know what you're doing, it's best to have a convenient editor, so you wouldn't create a broken localization file or forget about string length and formatting.
If you're a beginner, I highly recommend using [POEdit](https://github.com/vslavik/poedit), [Lokalize](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.lokalize) or simular tools.

#### Step by step guide
1. Download the editor
2. Open the `.pot` file, which contains a list of all translatable strings. If you want to edit an existing localization, open the corresponding `.po` file.
3. Start going through each string, translating them as you see fit. If you can't think of a good translation, you can find the correct term using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com), [Google Translate](https://lingva.ml/), or in a glossary.
4. Upload the new `.po` files. A commit message should be something like `Add German translation`, not `Upload de.pot`. Don't forget to also add your name to the credits! :)
